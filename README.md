### Bugs
+ **Solved bugs**

1.I was able to resolve some bugs in the userChoice function, such as correctly assigning the DOM elements, which previously caused issues with capturing user input and resulted in unexpected behavior.

2.After thorough debugging, I successfully fixed the issues with the disappearing buttons upon Player 1's selection and ensured the smooth transition to display the text 'Waiting for Player 2 to choose...' while waiting for the second player's input.
 -The solution involved carefully reviewing the code responsible for handling the button visibility and implementing the necessary adjustments to ensure that the buttons properly disappear after Player 1's choice and the text "Waiting for Player 2 to choose..." appears seamlessly, providing a more polished and user-friendly experience during the gameplay.


+ **Unsolved bugs**

 - None.

---

+ **Mistakes**

 - During the process of committing changes, a few mistakes were made, such as accidentally including unrelated files, using improper commit messages, and forgetting to stage certain modifications, which led to some confusion and difficulties in tracking the progress of the project.

 - Moving forward, I have taken these mistakes as valuable learning experiences, and I am committed to improving my version control practices during future commits. I will be more diligent in reviewing changes, writing clear and descriptive commit messages, and double-checking the files I include in each commit to ensure a smoother and more organized development process.
